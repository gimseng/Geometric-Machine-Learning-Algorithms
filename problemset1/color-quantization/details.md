### Color Quantization

This is a getting **started** file.

The code in *color_quantization.py* was not written by me.

To make color_quantization work you will need to do is to change the following command :

``` python
loaded_image =mpimg.imread('C:/Users/munim/Dropbox/z.jpg')
```

This basically loads the image from the hard drive. In the case above I am loading an image from my local folder “C:/Users/munim/Dropbox/z.jpg'”.
You will need to change that folder to your local folder where you have the image.
Try to choose a relatively low resolution so that the code runs without any trouble. Run the code on that image after putting it on your harddrive.
The program will generate three images as output : the original image, the Quantized image with K-means and the Quantized image with random color selection.
