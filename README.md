# Geometric Machine Learning Algorithms

Here are some *geometric* machine learning algorithms I wrote.


These  packages/libraries are used throughout this repository:
1. [scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
2. [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/)
3. [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
4. [networkx](matplotlib.org)
5. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

I highly recommend that you [install] *anaconda*. All of the packages in the above list come with Anaconda except for networkx. To install networkx [go to this link]

Here's a list of algorithm implemented in this repo:

**Section 1**
1. color quantization via **k-means** and random selection

**Section 2**
2. minimal spanning tree via my implementation of **kruskals algorithm**

**Section 3**
3. **Breadth first search** algorithm to compute the connected components of a graph.
4. **Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree** via my implementation of **kruskals algorithm**
5. **Zahn's Clustering Algorithm**
6. **ε-neighborhood graph** (epsilon neighborhood graph)
7. **ε-neighborhood graph clusters**
8.
