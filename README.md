# Geometric Machine Learning Algorithms

Here are some *geometric* machine learning algorithms I wrote.


These  packages/libraries are used throughout this repository:
1. [scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
2. [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/)
3. [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
4. [networkx](matplotlib.org)
5. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

I highly recommend that you [install] *anaconda*. All of the packages in the above list come with Anaconda except for networkx. To install networkx [go to this link]
