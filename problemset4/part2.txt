Dataset 1:

7-Give an estimation of how many connected components probably this data has
based on 0-persistence diagram
1 long bar, so the data has one cluster/connected components and rest is noise


8-Does the data have any important(long bars)1-persistence feature?
Explain your observation.
Data has one long bar so it probably has one genus 



9-Write down the persistence of the highest 1-feature.
(Recall that persistence of a bar = death -birth)
persistence = 1.55-0.2 = 1.35


Dataset 2:

7-Give an estimation of how many connected components probably this data has
based on 0-persistence diagram
Since there's only one big line, it is probably 1 cluster/1 connected component
figure with the rest being noise.


8-Does the data have any important(long bars)1-persistence feature?
Explain your observation.
Data has two almost equal long bars. This probably means that the data has 2 genus, probably like an 8.


9-Write down the persistence of the highest 1-feature.
(Recall that persistence of a bar = death -birth)
persistence = 1.75-0.5 = 1.25
